[list] 
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=802066100][b]Fine Road Anarchy[/b][/url] [b]is highly recommended![/b] ([i]mod works without it but you won't be able to connect some segments without an anarchy mod[/i]) 
[*]Mod is [b]not compatible[/b] with Network Skins - [b]WORKAROUND[/b]: Take a similar road of the same width to lay with this mod. Disable the mod and then simply upgrade it with a road from Network Skins
[*]Sharp angles produce weird results, curves work better
[*]Roads will always follow terrain elevation 
[*]Visual overlay guides have a little issue with curves (it's hard to explain) but it's only a little visual glitch that disappears as soon as you click to set curve's angle

[*]Ability to toggle on/off terrain conforming
